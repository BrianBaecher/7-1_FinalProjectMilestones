<b>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?</b>
None.

What design process did you follow for your project work?
The rubric.

How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?
I know what a bad set of instructions looks like.

What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?
None.

How did iteration factor into your development?
Seeing as how this class had us setting transform co-ords of mesh components via code, creating the 3d objects required a lot of 'iterating' upon transform values until the object looked halfway decent. I've brought up many times how this approach seriously deviates from best practices.

How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?
It didn't.

How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?
I learned nothing from this class that I didn't already know from a few hours spent in Blender.
