<b>What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?<b/> <br/>
<p>None.</p>

<b>What design process did you follow for your project work?</b> <br/>
<p>The rubric.</p>

<b>How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?</b> <b/>
<p>I now know what a bad set of instructions looks like.</p>  

<b>What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?</b> <br/>
<p>None.</p>  

<b>How did iteration factor into your development?</b> <br/>
<p>Seeing as how this class had us setting transform co-ords of mesh components via code, creating the 3d objects required a lot of 'iterating' upon transform values until the object looked halfway decent. I've brought up many times how this approach seriously deviates from normal procedures.</p>  

<b>How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?<b/> <br/>
<p>It didn't.</p>  

<b>How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?</b> <br/>
<p>I learned nothing from this class that I didn't already know from a few hours spent in Blender and Unity.</p>
